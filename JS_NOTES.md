# JavaScript notes

## React and frameworks in general
* two-way data binding: means nothing else than updates to the data
  (model) reflecting in the UI (view) part and changes in the view part
  affecting the state data (model) in return. Everything is connected!

* routing: a specific view of the app is tied to a specific URL, so that
  I can both retrieve the view from the URL and have the URL change when
  my view changes.
