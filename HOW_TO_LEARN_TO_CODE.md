# How to learn to code

## Initial thoughts
So it's effectively 2016 and you want to learn to code. Great - lets see
what we need to cover:

* mobile: native has won, but native is hard. Still: Swift!
* backend: Rails is the old giant. Versatile but not fast. Good all
  around, tricky at times. Still so much better than PHP and Java that
  those should as well vanish.
* frontend: JS frameworks are it. But: hard to understand reasoning when
  just starting out. Seems a basic intro to HTML/CSS/JSS would be cool,
  minimal jQuery and then straight into basic React (or Ember? Angular?)
* backend: with all the JS wizardry going on, node is a strong contender
  it seems. Still, good to get exposure to more than just one language
  if you can make it work at all. (e.g. Rails + React, Swift + React)
* databases: well, leave those out. Yes, Mongo etc are interesting, but
  only once you have an app with >20k users. (Although it gets really
  interesting at that point...)
* Devops: decisive tech here is Docker. Do you need it for development?
  Hard to say - if it works, it works well. If not, you may find
  yourself spending a week to (not) fix it.
* tools/utilities: Guard! (Possibly Gulp..) And git! GitHub! gems, ENV
  (e.g. via Figaro) Branches: master, production, feature branches FTW!
* simple Heroku production app: Do it once at least. For Rails/ Sinatra:
  Set up Puma, set up custom domain - hooray!
* webserver: if you have a VPS, then nginx is interesting to see, I
  guess.
* monitoring, CI: hm, it's interesting to work with. Not sure if you
  really need it.
* APIs: hidden gems, as you wouldn't use many of them in a real-world
  job. Twitter, Imgur: great fun!
* Ruby basics: probably underestimated. See if you can find a csv with
  values and then play around with those. Structs, arrays, ... - all
  really valuable. Scraping web pages, creating files: yes, very much!
  (yml storage?)
