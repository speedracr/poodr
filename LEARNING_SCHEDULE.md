# Learning schedule - Project Step-up

* framework: 90 days to more Ruby awesomeness
* knowledge sources:
  * books (POODR, Pragmatic Programmer?)
  * tutorials (Railstut, one-off tuts)
  * Ruby tapas (operationally: download to USB on Tuesdays??)
  * personal projects? (> connect with technologies: MongoDB, Sidekiq)
  * toolset: vim, emacs
  * adjacent technologies: Swift, Angular


* time constraints
  * 9.30am Standup
  * ca. 10.00 -12.00 work
  * 12.30 - lunch: Ruby tapas?
  * 14.00 - 15.00 work
  * 15.30 - 16.30 Monday, Wednesday, Friday: book work/ talks; Tuesday,
    Thursday: personal project
  * 16.45 to end: work

* Qs: POODR - moving slowly because of explanatory focus rather than
  instructive build. Anything to add to the reading???
  Personal projects: Seems good on the face of it. Is there other
  opportunity to work on side projects that relate to the Gapfish
  strategy?
  Gapfish architecture: Getting there, but the entire flow from sample
  to participation to etl is still abstract to me. Also: MongoDB role
  unclear in the details.
